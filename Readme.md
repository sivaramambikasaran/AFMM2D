AFMM2Dlib is a library for computing fast matrix-vector products. AFMM (Algebraic FMM) is an FMM (Fast Multipole Method) implementation where the low rank approximations of appropriate matrix sub-blocks are formed in an algebraic fashion. Low-rank approximation of the appropriate blocks is obtained using ACA. The domain is subdivided based on a KDTree. The algorithm has been parallelized using OpenMP. The code is written in C++ and features an easy-to-use interface.
